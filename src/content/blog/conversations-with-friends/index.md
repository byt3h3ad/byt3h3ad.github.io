I feel old writing this. College is wrapping up, real soon. I still remember catching the half an hour flight to Silchar for the first time, the excitement of meeting everyone. And then time flew. Flew so fast. Like wind sweeping away sand that I held in my hands, before I knew it, I am left with too little, too soon. I am left here, standing with my hands cupped, almost empty.

I have always struggled with people. I can make friends quite easily, but keeping them around is something I haven't been able to figure out. And it used to keep clawing me in the back of my mind. How a person who was so dear to me is now a stranger, just a gentle nod when we make an awkward eye contact.

I had a conversation on this with a friend. She posted a write up about this a few days ago - which in turn made me overthink about all these again.

Maybe we're all butterflies, flying at our own beat, in a fleeting moment in the canvas of time.
