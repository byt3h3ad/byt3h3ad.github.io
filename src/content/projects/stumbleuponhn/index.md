[StumbleUpon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StumbleUpon) used to be a discovery engine that allowed users to find new and interesting web pages based on their interests. Taking the same idea, StumbleUpon HN is a website that directs you to random Hacker News Best Stories using their [API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API). Used React Server-side Components for the first time.
