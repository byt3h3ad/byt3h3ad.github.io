- Built a website for users to highlight their best tweets, serving as a non-premium alternative to Twitter Highlights.

- Implemented Twitter OAuth using Supabase and PostgreSQL as database with Drizzle ORM for queries and schemas.

- Developed using TypeScript, NextJS for frontend, Zustand for state management, and Tanstack Query for data-fetching.

- Implemented [unstable_cache](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/unstable_cache) to cache the fetched tweets and decrease load time.

- Part of [buildspace nights and weekend s5](https://x.com/byt3h3ad/status/1804826499448803507).
