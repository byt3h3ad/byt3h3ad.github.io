UnProxy was a hackathon project that aimed to ease the process of taking attendance in classes, reduce errors and minimise proxies. Hence, UnProxy.

The novelty of the project was using a dynamic QR code for students to scan which updated their attendance in the Firebase Realtime Database.

Coupled with an Android [client](https://github.com/interstellar07/unproxy).

It was a sweet project that bagged us two first positions in two hackathons. Aura++.

Abandoned because you never dig your own grave.
